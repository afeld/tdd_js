# Test-Drive Your JavaScript

To most people building websites, writing JavaScript means copying-and-pasting a couple of jQuery snippets onto a page to get a button to animate.  While the proliferation of JavaScript frameworks has helped make code more organized, testing front-end code is still far from the norm.  We will go through the different types of testing, how to set up a test runner, writing unit and integration tests, and refactoring code to make it test*able*.  You will leave this talk fitter, happier, and less likely to create globals.
