# Test-Drive Your JavaScript

To most people building websites, writing JavaScript means copying-and-pasting a couple of jQuery snippets onto a page to get a button to animate.  While the proliferation of JavaScript frameworks has helped make code more organized, testing front-end code is still far from the norm.  We will go through the different types of testing, how to set up a test runner, writing unit and integration tests, and refactoring code to make it test*able*.  You will leave this talk fitter, happier, and less likely to create globals.

  * Complements frameworks in encouraging code to be well organized
* Flavors of testing
  * Unit
    * Test a piece in isolation
  * Integration
    * Test a bunch of pieces together
  * Test a piece [and everything below it] in isolation
* Write a test framework

* Best practices
  * Writing code to be testable
  * Breaking things into small pieces
  * Avoiding state
  * Coding from the outside in â€“ think of testing as UI/UX design for your code
  * Writing tests forces better code
